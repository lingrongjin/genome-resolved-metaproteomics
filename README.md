# Workflow for paired metagenomic and metaproteomic analysis

# Introduction
Input: raw mass spectroscopy file, predicted ORFs from metagenome for each sample \
Output: MPA protein report, Prophane functional and taxonomic annotation summary report \
Software requirement: MetaProteomeAnalyzer, Prophane

# Workflow
# Spectrum correlation and protein grouping with MPA
# Taxonomic and functional annotation with Prophane
